# tsundere.me

Automatically locates faces using [facedetect](http://www.thregr.org/~wavexx/hacks/facedetect/) and then composites tsun~tsun~ eyes over them.

tsundere.me runs under uwsgi behind nginx, which handles all of the static files.

Processed images are uploaded to mediacrush rather than being stored locally.
